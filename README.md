# Hi there, this is my first Vue-Website

I built this during a two-day Hackaton at the end of the first half of my DevhausLeipzig CodeCamp-Experience

Thanks to Netlify you can easily visit it online here:

At first I added vuetify to the project, because I had no idea where I wanted to go with it, and ended up not using it.

I got a couple of ideas and even more inspiration from [TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia/videos)'s YT-Channel.

Many thanks to [Gabe](https://github.com/gabrielheinrich), Mat (who's Git-Identity I don't know :) ), [Val](https://github.com/valeriakori) and all my classmates at [DevhausLeipzig](https://github.com/devhausleipzig)!
